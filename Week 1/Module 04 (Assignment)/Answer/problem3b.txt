*args:

The *args syntax allows you to pass a variable number of positional arguments to a function.
 The asterisk (*) before args indicates that any number of positional arguments can be 
 passed, and they are collected into a tuple within the function.

 example: 
 def sum_values(*args):
    total = 0
    for num in args:
        total += num
    return total

result = sum_values(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
print(result) 

 Output: 15

**kwargs: 

The **kwargs syntax allows you to pass a variable number of keyword arguments to a function. 
The double asterisks (**) before kwargs indicate that any number of keyword arguments can be
 passed, and they are collected into a dictionary within the function.

 example: def print_info(**kwargs):
    for key, value in kwargs.items():
        print(f"{key}: {value}")

print_info(name="John", age=25, country="USA")

Output:
name: John
age: 25
country: USA
